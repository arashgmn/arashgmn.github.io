From time to time, I come across quotes or articles that are worth saving. The following is a continuously growing list of these for my future self to revisit, reflect upon, and contemplate.

## Title ethics
**Question**: Is it correct to call oneself "Doctor/Scientist/Mathemathician" simply because one has a PhD in that field?

**Answer**: "... Calling oneself a scientist is not unethical, no more than it is unethical to call oneself a musician without being in the Top100 charts. What is unethical is deliberately representing yourself in a way that causes people to assign you an authority that you do not have." -- *nengel* on [academic stack exchange](https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/97293/119123)
