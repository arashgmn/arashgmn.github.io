Hi, and thanks for coming by!

I'm Arash, and this is my website, where I write about stuff that matter to me or interest me. At the moment, I'm doing my PhD at [Tetzlab](tetzlab.com) on the intersection of computational neuroscience, biophysics, and statistical machine learning. 

I’m an engineer and a physicist by training, a mathematician by education, a researcher by job title, and an astronomer by hobby. I’m also trying to be a better being, and I believe writing is one way to do so.

I'm living in Germany in the little city of Göttingen, not too far from the grave of Max Plank, David Hilbert, Wilhelm Weber, Felix Klein, Ludwig Prandtl, Max Born, Karl Schwartzshild, and Gauss. But if you are not around, we can get in touch through any of thouse social media icons you see down below. 

If you are would like to know my general point of view, check out [here](/quotes).
