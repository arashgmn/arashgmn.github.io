Some problems are very easy to resolve, but, for whatever reason, they stay unresolved. What pisses me off so badly is that these ones also those that tend to reoccur. And so frequently so. To the extent that they don't seem simple anymore, but rather gigantic, challenging, and unresovlable ones. I wish these issues had physical forms, so that I could place them on a big stone and hammer them down into little scattered pieces. To get rid of them, once for all. 

I wonder if having and dealing with such problems is the *normality* of life. Aren't we, humans, supposed to dominate our problems, solve them, and create new better environments? Why doesn't it happen then? Am I the problem? Am I even doing my normal human stuff? It seems like all I'm doing is to add more pain and agony to my surronding. What the hell am I doing and why is this happening? I wish I had a place to go and talk freely and openly, and get consoled. Frustrating!
