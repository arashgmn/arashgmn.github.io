I think there's no wrong decision in general. Instead, there are just consequences. Whether or a given consequence make one happy or not, ultimately, depends on the decision, not even the consequence, but on how one can live with the consequence. You can be a risk-taker or a risk-averse -- for whatever reason. That strategy plus the consequence would determine your happiness. If we add the golden rule of happiness, i.e.,

> happiness = realization - expectation

one reinvents the wheel of reinforcement learning. Wow.
