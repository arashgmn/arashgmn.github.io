Bernstein conference of this year had a useful PhD symposium. My takeaway is to be aware of these:

- **upward management**: How to manage your advisor
- **maintaining colabs**: collaborations aren't formed by *starting* them and wishing them to continue. This approach is very similar to mass application during job search, pointless. Figure out *what exactly* do you want from that collab. You can't expect them be form a classroom for you. They appreciate if you "upward manage" them and tell them what the should do.
- **Nice people": Most people are actaully nice. If they can't help, they'll say so. But most often they are eager to help. Don't remember that.

Thins to research about:
- identity work -- read Richard Gao's blog
- gender diversity
