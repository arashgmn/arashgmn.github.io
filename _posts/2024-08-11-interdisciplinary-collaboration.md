I have been involved in two different goverment-funded interdisciplinary research projects. Both followed similar theme: one group of experimental folks (hereafter E) are supposed to work with theorists (T). On the paper, it is a good idea. In practive, however, it often fails I reckon.

The obvious thing is these group of people have *very* different goals, and it doesn't stop there. Depending on the domain, the distinction between the two groups might be also very multi-layered. Yet, strangly, such collaboration are often formed very organically! Not because of the science, but money: Some poeple from E and T meet, and send a proposal to a major agency for fund, and the organic collaboraiton ends just there! As soon as the money flows each group moves on with their own agenda (plus a few showcase joint publication). They, or at least one of them, don't listen to learn from thet other because they are deeoly indifferent.  When even one side is not open-minded to listen and learn, the whole thing colapses. Since the reaction of less open group likely demotivates the eager folks.

I personally admire and aspire joint collaboration between E and T groups. And indeed there are some that pass the test of time. In my view, these influencial works follow these patterns:

1. Both main figures of E and T groups are major figures in their own field,
2. they are fairly senior, and already have a fairly large network of collaborators,
3. **they regocnize a stagnation in their research and reach out to other group for help**,
4. both groups are **open** to suggestions and knowledge of the other group (because it is really their problem too).

These type of collabs actually flurish, and tend to be influencial, perhaps because patterns 1 and 2 strongly correlate with the experimence, which already makes poeple of both sides to stray less. Also motivation due to 3 shouldn't be oversought. 

There are very few poeple in the world that can form such meaningful collabs. Poor junior researchers that have to live between the tense cultral difference of E and T.
