*Succession* has a bold and daring soundtrack. The rapid sequence of the first two sets of notes, which defy familiar chords, is followed by a progressively higher cascade of notes spanning three octaves within the first ten seconds. And in case you missed this audacious scatter of notes, the piece offers an even bolder orchestral repetition, ensuring that you, as the audience, are acutely aware of the dark, fast-paced show you're about to watch. It also ties in perfectly with the show's theme: such a broad tonal range (three octaves) makes the music unsingable for an average person. How powerful is that? The composer essentially says, 'I don't care if you can sing my music or not. It flows, whether you like it or not. And you cannot ignore it. It comes to you, in dark ways you cannot avoid...'

Love it!
