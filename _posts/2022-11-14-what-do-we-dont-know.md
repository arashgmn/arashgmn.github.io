It's about time that I forge my research question. I know a couple of things which are theoretically appealing. But, they don't come across as being relevant in daily life, by any sense. What is worst is that the further I read, the more attention I pay to my knowns and less to my unknowns. This is rather scary. Need to revise my thinking. Thus, this mind searching.

# Issues
- With a little amount of knowledge, how to find the correct question? (*philosophical and unsolvable for ever*)
- What makes a question interesting for me? Should it be mathematically advanced or simple? Should it have direct tangable implication or not? (*personal but solvable now*)
- Even if I found that question, how should it be pitched / purified?  (*scientific prtactice and hard for now*)
- How to sell it? (*marketing and ungly, independent of solvable or not*)

I drop the first issue. Can't do much for it. I assume the brain has so many unknowns which even if I pick one topic randomly it still needs further research. So, that's done. The second issue is really the key here. I sapre it for the next section. The third and forth are more related to story telling. Don't like it, but will find a way when polish my presentation.

# My interesting question
It's fascinating how the brain computes. We've got so much processing power. So much storage capacity. And can actively change it. Can do this very thing (the soul searching) to figure out what is core to ourselves.

I enjoy when I see a device computing things. Would be even meta if it learns how to handle its input. That's brain. But, quite orthogonally, I also envy music in a meaningfully significant way. I see it as a magical phenomenon really.

> "Music is a strong magic." Said Dumbledore, crying his tears.

I know the my question: it is the dynamical reachness of my computing reservoir. The utmost goal would be quantifying that. But, for know, I would like to focus only on the synaptic plasticity part of it. Indeed elegant. But barely understandable for an experimentalist. So the question is how can explain this to my grandmother? What is the good daily-life, exmaple and what is the correct cartoon? If I find that, then the issue is solved.
