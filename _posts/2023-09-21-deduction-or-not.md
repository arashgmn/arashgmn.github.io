I am reading a rather old review which has rasied a few points that despite being reasonable, I disagree with them. I noticed that my disagreement isn't because the statements are flawed, but instead because I have spend much more time on another paper that used an alternative approch to the one this review suggests.

Both are equally reasonable. But since I'm exposed to the latter more (as I spend more time on it), I'm already biased to it, and am rejecting the arguments of the review article at my hand, simply it isn't confirming my (biased) point of view.

Yeah, yeah. We're all like that. But it's truly worrisome.
